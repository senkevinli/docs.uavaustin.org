# About the Organization

## What We Do

- We build a fixed-wing aircraft.
- We add hardware to the aircraft so that it can fly autonomously, take pictures, and communicate with a ground station.
- We write software that assists with recognizing images and reporting telemetry data to the competition server.
- We meet for 5 hours a week.
- We have regular socials, if that isn't enough.
- We test the UAS once a month.
- We write a paper about the UAS.
- We record a video about the UAS.
- We take the UAS to Maryland in June for a demonstration.

## What We Don't Do

- We do not build quadcopters, hexacopters, or anything that ends with "-copter."
- We do not write our own autopilot software; instead, we use the well-tested [ArduPilot](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot) firmware.
- We do not allow just anyone to fly the plane: only the selected ground station operator and safety pilot can fly the plane. (If you are looking to free fly, you might be interested in Design/Build/Fly.)
- We do not fly the plane for any purpose other than the AUVSI SUAS competition.

## Governance Model

In May 2019, a [constitution](https://github.com/uavaustin/governance) was passed to facilitate a formal transfer of power from the large number of graduating seniors to the next leadership.

The constitution was fast-tracked due to a new requirement by the Office of the Dean of Students to submit a constitution; however, subsequent bylaws that affirm the constitution's authority have not been passed. One such important bylaw is the collection of dues.

## Meetings

Hardware meetings have typically been held in the computer lab of the Aerospace Department, while software meetings take up a classroom in the same building. Software meets twice a week totaling 5 hours a week, while hardware meets thrice a week totaling 9 hours a week.

Software meetings have usually been Sundays and Thursdays; however, since the destruction of the WRW building, it has been significantly more difficult to find classrooms.

Software and hardware leads are charged with taking care of attendance, which is instrumental for understanding member turnover. It is often the case that members vanish about five weeks into the semester without notice.

### Camp

At the beginning of the year, there is typically a "camp" for both hardware and software members to discern their preference and determine whether or not they have the time commitment to continue. During this period, software meets three times a week, usually in separate classrooms to minimize distractions between teams.

The camp lasts three weeks, sometimes coinciding with the opening of registration for SUAS.
