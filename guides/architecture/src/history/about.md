# About the Competition

The main purpose of UAV Austin is to compete in the [Student Unmanned Aerial Systems Competition](https://auvsi-suas.org), which is run by the Seafarer Chapter of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. Otherwise known as the AUVSI SUAS competition, the competition is held yearly at Webster Field in St. Inigoes, MD.

While the competition in itself is rather brief and the organization consistently makes a net loss, the University continues to fund the organization because of its intrinsic educational value. Systems engineering is a multidisciplinary field that is not rigorously taught in formal courses, so the Aerospace Engineering department funds UAV Austin to provide an extracurricular, hands-on approach to learning systems engineering.

The full history of UAV Austin is unknown, as the original senior members have since left. The only person who has assisted UAVA from its conception in 2006 has been Mark Maughmer II, the designated safety pilot who is also a staff member for the Aerospace Engineering department.

The goal of SUAS is to present to judges an unmanned aerial system (UAS) that can safely perform the following objectives:

- Fly autonomously through a given set of waypoints
- Avoid virtual obstacles
- Locate and recognize objects on the ground
- Deliver a payload

Teams are subranked based on their technical paper, "flight readiness review" (a 10-minute video), and mission. Their ranking in each of these categories determines the prize money allotted to them, which can exceed $6,000.

SUAS is a systems engineering competition. It is only tangentially related to aerospace engineering in that it requires the construction of an aircraft, but it could otherwise be any vehicle.

As such, many teams opt to fly kit planes, quadcopters, and hexacopters, instead of manufacturing their own aircraft. However, we create our own aircraft because aerospace engineering is the specialty of our department, and we also wish to give members experience in computer-aided design and manufacturing.

The most important part of the UAS is arguably the software, as the software ultimately provides the autonomy of the aircraft and the ability to complete the mission objectives for prize money. The importance of software is so prominent that the competition host, Phillip Tischler, is a senior software engineer at Google.
