# Target Finder

Frankly, I don't know too much about the history of Target Finder other than that it is written in Python, using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and a neural network called YOLOv3. The model takes a while to generate, and due to the low number of real images with targets, the network is trained using procedurally generated images instead by superimposing a fake target on grass.

It remains relatively unintegrated with the image recognition pipeline.
