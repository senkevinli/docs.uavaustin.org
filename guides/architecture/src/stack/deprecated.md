# Deprecated Services

## Dashboard (Orchestra)

This was a command-line interface intended to show the health of various Orchestra services in a full-screen, text-based environment. However, it did not prove to be very useful and was scrapped in favor of Grafana.

## Flight View

This was a frontend project to simplify details about the aircraft in one screen. After three major refactors, Flight View was finally scrapped.

However, a frontend is important for manual image recognition and to understand the status of the aircraft, critical services, and the interop without needing to plug into Mission Planner.
