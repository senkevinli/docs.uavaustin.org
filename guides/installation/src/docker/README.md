# Docker

Here at UAV Austin, we rely heavily on Docker and Docker Compose for our services so it's important that you get Docker + friends installed and set up on your computer. Before you can follow these steps you must [set up your OS](../getting-started/README.md).

Once again, instructions vary based on your OS.
