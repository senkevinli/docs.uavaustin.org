# Getting Started

Before getting our hands dirty with JavaScript, we'll need to set up our
environment and make sure it's working. In this section, we'll get Node.js
installed on your system, do a quick hello world, and give some resources that
could help out later in learning and building up your JavaScript and Node.js
skills.
