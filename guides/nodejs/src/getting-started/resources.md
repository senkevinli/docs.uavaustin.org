# Resources

There are a ton of great resources on JavaScript and Node.js, to where it can
almost get overbearing.

If you're looking for another book that goes more in depth about JavaScript, or
aren't comfortable with the format in this guide, I would recommend the
following free sources:

- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net)
- [A re-introduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)

For general documentation, the following are very useful:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp)

Note that these tend to be more focused on browser JavaScript rather than
server-side like in Node.js.

> *Note:* A thing to remember in looking up things in JavaScript is that the
> language has evolved a bit over time. This particular guide predominately
> uses features from the ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6) specification and
> later. If you come accross some archaic syntax, it's helpful to look at the
> date the content was published.
