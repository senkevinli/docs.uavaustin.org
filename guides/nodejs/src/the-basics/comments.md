# Comments

Comments in JavaScript are the same as what you'd see in other C-like
languages.

Basic comments are started with `//` like so:

```js

// Hello.

```

Normally, when wanting multi-line comments, it's standard to keep repeating the
`//` pattern on each line:

```js

// This is a crazy long comment that can't be
// contained on one line!

```

You can also use `/* */` to make comments span multiple lines.

```js

/* This comment just got
   even crazier. */

```

Though, the `/* */` pattern is conventionally used for documentation
comments on functions, classes, or modules.
