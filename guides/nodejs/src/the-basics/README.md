# The Basics

This section covers basic programming concepts that are common to most
programming langauges. Nothing here is particularly unique to JavaScript, and
should be familiar in the context of other programming languages.

You'll learn about comments, the basic data types and variables in JavaScript,
control flow mechanisms like `if` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops,
and functions.
