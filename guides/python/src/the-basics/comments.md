# Comments

Comments in Python are started with a hashtag / number sign / pound sign / hash
/ octothorpe / `#`.

```python

# Hola.

```

Comments can start at the beginning of a line or be after other code.

```python

tweet = '#rude'  # The hashtag in the string doesn't make a comment.

```

Note that if code is being indented in Python, make sure the comments are
indented the same as the rest of the block. ***Indentation matters in
Python!***
