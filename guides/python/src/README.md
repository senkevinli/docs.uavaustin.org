# Introduction

This guide gives a brief introduction to the Python programming language.

Python is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language. Python is often
seen as a great introductary language, and also a great asset to know for many
serious projects. Many things difficult in other languages can be simplied in
Python.

xkcd sums up the language pretty well. :)

## Structure

This guide assumes some prior programming language experience in a language
such as Java, JavaScript, or C++. Concepts common to most programming languages
are run through quickly in the beginning. This guide does not dive as deep into
the language as the other UAV Austin language guides. The basics of Python are
quite simple comparitively, and much of the difficulty in the Python world is
understanding how to use common Python libraries as opposed to how to deal with
the language itself. This guide can be categorized in two sections:

- In the [The Basics](the-basics/index.html) chapters, we'll cover the very
  fundamentals of the language, which are common to other languages.

- Afterwards, we'll cover several other topics such as being able to do file
  input and output, so that you can have a grasp on how to use the language in
  some practical applications. Other topics above basic control flow are also
  discussed to give some familiarity to other concepts in Python you might
  encounter later on.

Before beginning, go to the [Getting Started](getting-started/index.html)
section to get your environment set up.
