# Convolutional Neural Networks

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of neural network primarily used for image recognition and classification.
They take an image and translate it into an array of numbers representing each pixel and its color.
The difference between CNNs and regular neural networks is that the layers are not all fully connected.
The input and outputs are of each hidden layer 3D matrices of width, height, and depth.
