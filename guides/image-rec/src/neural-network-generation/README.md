# Neural Network Generation

By now, we know what neural networks are and how they work.
But how do we train them to be used on different datasets?
And what should our dataset look like?
In this section, we will learn what real competition data looks like,
how to generate enough of it to train a neural net,
and how to actually create a model using these computer generated images.
