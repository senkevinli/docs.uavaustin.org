# Tensorflow

The Inception-V3 model is designed to be able to accurately classify thousands of classes within a very small margin of error.
It is also intended to identify complex classes (such as animals, plants, or people) with busy backgrounds.
Its architecture is much more complicated than anything we would need to identify basic shapes with plain backgrounds.

One possibility moving forward would be to create a simple CNN with only a few hidden layers to decrease training and processing time.
However, it is a very low priority and difficult task, as TensorFlow is not intuitive and can be painful to use at times.
As such, this page will exist as a guide for interested members to explore further on their own time and will not be covered during the camp itself.

## Resources for Learning TensorFlow:
[A Very Long List of Wonderful Videos for Learning TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v) - 
The relevant videos from this playlist are videos 43 through 52 and 56 through 62.
These videos are very long and there are a lot of them, but in my opinion this is the best tutorial out there for creating CNNs with TensorFlow.

[MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) - 
A database of handwritten alphanumerics to train/test your CNN on.

[The Official TensorFlow CNN Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/cnn) - 
My LEAST favorite TensorFlow tutorial. 
Not at all intuitive for beginners.
Use this if you have a very specific question, but not for learning about CNNs in general.
