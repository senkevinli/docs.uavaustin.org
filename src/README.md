These pages are still a work-in-progress. Pardon the mess. :construction:

Welcome to the UAV Austin Documentation page.

We're a team of engineers who build a plane and ground station system to
compete in the annual [AUVSI SUAS Competition](http://www.auvsi-suas.org), *or
at least we like to think so*.

For this competition, we make our plane fly autonomously and run through a
simulated mission where we have to identify objects on the ground
automatically.

Here's just some of the things we do:

- CAD modeling
- Plane design and implementation
- Flight tuning and optimization
- Image recognition with machine learning (Tensorflow / Python)
- Obstacle Avoidance
- Create ground station GUIs with HTML / CSS / JavaScript

If you're interesting in joining, come to our first meeting for Spring 2017!

**Sunday, 21 Jan 2017, 3:00 PM in WRW 313**
